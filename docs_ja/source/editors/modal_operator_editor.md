# Modal Operator Editor

A **Modal Operator** is an interactive tool that "locks" Blender into a particular operation until the user decides to confirm or cancel.  
For example, the built-in **Rotate** tool (accessed via the {kbd}`R` hotkey) is a typical modal operator â€” while rotating, you can adjust the angle in real-time, and only when you confirm or cancel does Blender return to its normal state.

When using modal operators, you can define sub-hotkeys (or sub-keys) for extra control. For example, you can create hotkeys to toggle options or change parameters with mouse movements.

## Editor Overview
Below is an example of the **Modal Operator Editor** interface in PME:

The editor consists of multiple **slots** where you can assign commands or property changes for various sub-hotkeys. Here is a closer look at the slot tabs:

## Slot Tabs
PME allows you to define how sub-hotkeys behave by creating different **slots** inside the Modal Operator.  
These slots can include scripting or property changes that get triggered during the modal session.

### Command
Assign a sub-hotkey to run Python code directly or to call an existing operator.

- **Example**: Pressing {kbd}`S` while the Modal Operator is active might scale the object via `bpy.ops.transform.resize('INVOKE_DEFAULT')`.

### Property
Assign a sub-hotkey (or mouse interaction) to change a property's value on the fly. This is especially useful for real-time adjustments within the modal operator.

**Hotkey Modes**:
   
- **Hotkey**  
  Press and hold the sub-hotkey, then move the mouse to change a property value.
  
- **Mouse Move**  
  Move the mouse to change the property value.  
  This blocks all other sub-hotkeys, so typically you'd use it together with {ref}`Confirm on Release <confirm-on-release>` so the operation finalizes when you release the mouse.

- **Mouse Wheel**  
  Scroll the mouse wheel to increment or decrement the property value.

### On Invoke
Python code executed **right when** the Modal Operator is invoked (i.e., when the user first activates it).

- Example: Initialize variables, store the starting position or angle, or set up a custom overlay.

### On Confirm
Python code executed **upon user confirmation** (e.g., pressing {kbd}`Enter` or releasing the initial hotkey under certain conditions).

### On Cancel
Python code executed **if the user cancels** the operation (e.g., pressing {kbd}`Esc` or right-clicking to abort).

### On Update
Python code that runs whenever any of the sub-hotkeys is pressed. This is handy for real-time feedback as the user interacts.

- **Assigning On Update to a specific sub-hotkey**: Place the "On Update" slot after that specific sub-hotkey slot.  
- **Assigning On Update to all sub-hotkeys**: Place it before all sub-hotkey slots (before any "Command" or "Property" slots).

## Scripting
PME provides two special functions to end a modal operator:  

````{py:function} confirm()
:noindex:

Confirms the modal operator.  

:return: `True`
````

````{py:function} cancel()
:noindex:

Cancels the modal operator.  

:return: `True`
````

By calling `confirm()` or `cancel()` in your Python code, you decide when the modal operator stops and whether its effects are applied or discarded.

## Settings

### Confirm on Release
If enabled, the modal operator automatically confirms when the user **releases** the initial hotkey used to invoke it.  
This is common in quick operations where you might hold down a key to make adjustments and let go to finalize them.

How it works:
- Press and hold the hotkey (e.g., {kbd}`R` for rotate).
- Drag the mouse to adjust the rotation (or any property).
- Release the hotkey to confirm immediately, without needing an extra {kbd}`Enter` keystroke.
